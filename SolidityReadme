1)What is a BlockChain. 

BlockChain is collection of Blocks. 

2) Blocks - who makes them ? and What does block chain consist of ? 
   Blocks are made by Nodes. 

   Each nodes runs a whole copy of the blockchain and they reach CONSENSUS among themselves to create a   
   new block having collection of transactions over time.



3).   What is consensus ? .. Consesus is formal process of creating an block from new Txns. 
  Much like elections that happen every 4 years to forma government. 
   
So Block formation is a process of forming of a single block  by NODEs that gets added to the tip of the block chain.



4). Consensus .. what ..?

   Now because block chain have very important property of being decentralized, meaning no single goverment can ctrol them 
   So every node forms a Block. And Every proposes that their block gets to the tip of the blockchain as there is an financial 
   incentive if their block gets elected they  rewards toekns for their (hard) work in forming the block.


5) Bitcoin Rewards , Ethereum Rewards etc.
